                <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">Ssesaazi Ismael was born on February 23, 2001, in Gayaza, Kyankwanzi district, Uganda. A Ugandan national, he is one of the eleven children of Mr. Kityo Swaib and Mrs. Nakimuli Mastula, both residents of Bugologolo-Gayaza in Kyankwanzi. As the middle child, Ssesaazi grew up within a family renowned for its noble ties and leadership in the community.
                    <br>His grandfather, known by his nickname "Kamasu" and formally named Eriasa Kamuli, played a prominent role in the local society. A close friend of the late King Muteesa II of Buganda, Kamuli and the King often spent leisure time hunting together. This bond led to Kamuli being appointed Chief of Gayaza Bugologolo in Kyankwanzi in 1962

                    <li style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">For secondary school, Ssesaazi attended Light College Secondary School in Kiboga District, later transferring to Kampala High School in Kampala District, where he sat for both the Uganda Certificate of Education (UCE) and the Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education (UACE). His time at Kampala High School marked significant educational achievements.</li>
